# Project-FM âš½
This is my first portfolio project after finalizing my Master's Degree in Data Science. For years I really enjoyed playing Football Manager from a users perspective, now I want to try the analytic way.

Football Manager is a simulation game where the player interpret the manager role in the game of football, is something similar to FIFA carrer mode but with tons of added complexity and granularity. In a sense is a more realistic approach, even real managers have been discover via Football Manager, that is one of the reasons I chose FM, the other is the amount of available data, which is huge and opens endeless possibilities for analytics and the applications for ML/DL methods in different forms. 

For practical reasons, restrictions needed to be made in order to make the analysis feasible and concrete, making it like a real business case.

I found a new job as a Director of Football in the third tier of Spanish football, the owner wants to try a new system based on data in order to maximize performance on the pitch without overpaying for players, as it has shown that is a sustainable business, eg. Brentford in the Premier League. All of the transfers, arrivals and departures are based on data, based on realism assumptions (on rules section). Personnel are also selected based on references from members of the club or job listings. The club culture, demands from the president or boards of members are considered in order to use the data and the decisions obtained via using ML/DL can be explained in a way that can be understand for a non-technical role.

ðŸ“œ RULES:

      - The game is played attibuteless, only stars can be viewed but only used as personnel judgement of a player as a tiebraker between two similar options
      - There is an absolute power in deciding which staff members to keep or not keep
      - Training and matches are all simulated and full responsability will be put in the second manager (Manager in the shadows)
      - Only players/staff within the scouting range are available for examination or transfers as in real life
      - All the decisions must be aligned with the manager/staff interests/playstyle, personnel must be aligned with president desires
